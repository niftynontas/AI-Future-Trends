# Edge AI Waste Classifier & Smart IoT Concepts
Welcome to this beginner-friendly project focused on developing an Edge AI waste classification model. Using a custom dataset, we train a lightweight CNN to recognize different waste types and convert it to TensorFlow Lite for deployment on edge devices like Raspberry Pi.

## Features
- Image classification model trained on custom trash dataset  
- TensorFlow Lite model for efficient edge deployment  
- AI-driven IoT concept proposal for smart agriculture  
- Ethical analysis on AI in personalized medicine  

## Getting Started
1. Upload your dataset organized by class folders (e.g., cardboard, plastic)  
2. Run the provided Colab notebook to train and convert the model  
3. Use the TFLite model for real-time waste classification on edge devices  

## Future Work
- Expand dataset size for better accuracy  
- Implement real IoT sensor integration  
- Develop frontend dashboards for monitoring
